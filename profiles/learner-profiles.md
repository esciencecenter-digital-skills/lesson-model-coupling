Robbie is in their second year of PhD in astrophysics of colliding solar systems. They developed a new high resolution model of planets in solar systems and wants to couple it with an existing large scale galaxy model to run simulations of colliding galaxies and the effect on the planets in the solar systems involved. Their new model is intended to replace an old planetary model if it performs better.

Robbie needs an easy way to couple both the old and new planetary model to the large scale galaxy model, run simulations and quickly change between running either of the combinations.

Beggy never did any model coupling but needs to start with that for their PhD in combining fluid simulations with a model of cell metabolism. They want to find out what frameworks, libraries and environments are available and most useful for their use case. They are interested in the theory of coupling various models, scales and learn about the terminology that is used.

title: Fusey Knowitall, Postdoc

Fusey has a quite advanced, complex piece of code that combines different mathematical models that together simulate a nuclear fusion reactor. The problem is that the different submodels are tangled together by pieces of code that are hard to understand. This makes it very hard to change one of the submodels to incorporate new scientific insights. Fusey would like to explore how they could make a more modular simulation where they can easily interchange and compare different parts of the system.
